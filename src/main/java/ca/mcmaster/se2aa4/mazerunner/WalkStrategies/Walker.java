 * Author: Zuhair Qureshi
 * Description: This abstract class acts as a base class for all walker types, providing core 
 * movement logic and structure for maze navigation. It stores the current coordinates and 
 * direction of the walker, provides methods to turn left, turn right, and move in the current direction,
 * encodes movement logic using a 2D array of direction vectors, and requires subclasses to implement 
 * the walk method, defining specific navigation behaviors.
